# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it.

The computer chooses a word from a list of words and prompts the user to guess the word by entering a single letter. In this implemention based on object oriented programming a method validates the user input and checks if the entry matches any letter in the word. It displays a placeholder for the word with correct the guesses. The player has limited number of attempts. The game ends when the word is correctly guessed or the given number of attempts exceeded.

Through this project I came to implement abstraction, encapsulation concepts of object oriented programming. Most importantly I had the experience of fitting different methods and attributes together in a way that they could work.For instance I had two conflicting 'while true' loops causing an infinite loop. I resolved it by refactoring the code.
